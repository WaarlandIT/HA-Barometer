The Barometer I used is based on Richi Bowzer's barometer but couldn't find his original post anymore. 

There are some things you need.
- In HACS you need to install the Frontend addon "Flexible Horseshoe Card"
- You also need 6 images, you can find them in the weather folder in this repo.
- Some yaml code
   
It's still work in progress
